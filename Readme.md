# How to Use exhume.link: A Guide to Exporting Your Open Tabs

The first step to analyzing your open tabs with exhume.link is getting a list of their URLs. Here is how you can do that, depending on your browser.

## Step 1: Copy Your Open Tab URLs

### 📱 For Safari on iPhone and iPad

Safari on iOS and iPadOS has a convenient built-in feature to copy links from all your open tabs at once.

**Instructions:**
1.  Open Safari on your iPhone or iPad.
2.  Tap and hold the **Tabs** button (the two overlapping squares in the bottom-right corner).
3.  A menu will pop up. Tap on **Copy Links**.
4.  All the URLs from your open tabs are now copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted.

### 🖥️ For Safari on macOS

Safari on your Mac also has a native feature for this, accessible through the sidebar.

**Instructions:**
1.  Open Safari on your Mac.
2.  If the sidebar is not visible, click the **Sidebar** button in the toolbar (it looks like a square with a left-side panel).
3.  In the sidebar, right-click on the tab group you want to copy, or on the "X Tabs" label at the top of the tab list.
4.  Select **Copy Links** from the menu. The URLs are now on your clipboard.

### 🌐 For Chrome, Firefox, and Edge

For browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, you will need to install a safe browser extension. Once installed, simply click the extension icon in your toolbar and select the option to copy all your open tab URLs to your clipboard.

Personal recommendation: [Onetab](https://www.one-tab.com).

There are other extensions I have found online that seem to serve the same function but I have personally not used them. Please use them after understanding their risk.

* **Google Chrome:** [Copy All URLs](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/copy-all-urls/iiagcalhlpmgdipdcikkjiliaankcagj), [Umbrella](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/umbrella-copy-all-urls/iodlbflkegnangnopebgjojlgmcbbpdh)
* **Mozilla Firefox:** [Copy URL of All Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-url-of-all-tabs/)
* **Microsoft Edge:** [Copy All Urls](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/copy-all-urls/pnifopiiginkkodeanknklhahdpnmech)
